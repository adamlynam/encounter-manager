This is a D&D 5e compatible encounter manager designed to make running a battle easier on a DM.

This project relies on data files from [5etools](https://5etools.com/) found in the source code available on [TheGiddyLimit GitHub](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/TheGiddyLimit.github.io)

There should be a working copy of this app running at http://encounter-manager.lynam.co.nz/ if you would like to see it running.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
